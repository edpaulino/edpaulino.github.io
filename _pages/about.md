<p>“People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” – Maya Angelou.</p>

 <p>As someone on a mission to connect people, policy, and place, these words drive the work I do every day. The test is a simple one. Put aside the numbers for a moment and ask "how are you making people feel?" It’s the ultimate gut check. Whether it’s about policy, product, or programs, it’s important to connect to others in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>That’s what my work is all about. I’m passionate about sparking successful partnerships between government, the public, and everything in between. With the curiosity of a policy wonk and the heart of a campaign organizer, I live to bridge the divide between ideas and impact in people’s lives.</p>

<p>In my current role at the New Jersey State Office of Innovation, I conduct policy analysis and drive statewide public engagement initiatives. Through the SmarterNJ initiative, I help connect the public, community groups, private enterprise, and government to collaborate and improve the policymaking process. Though the pandemic created barriers to bringing people together, these challenges have led to the creation of tools and strategies that keep us connected.</p>

<p>In the past I’ve advanced legislation at the NYC Council, managed print and broadcast media relations, coordinated contentious real estate projects, organized voters in local, gubernatorial, and presidential campaigns, managed workforce and economic development programs, and drafted feasibility studies on urban revitalization initiatives.</p>

<p>Areas of policy expertise and interest include real estate (affordable housing, zoning/land use), sustainability (distributed generation, CCA), transportation (FHVs, micromobilty/microtransit), human services (homelessness prevention, family support), and government innovation (charter cities, citizen juries).</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss an opportunity or challenge at the intersection of government and the public.</p>
